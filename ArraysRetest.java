				It should have the methods:
					
					Getters and Setters for all state variables
					printOrderDetails(), which will iterate through the Strings

			Now create a class called OrderInfoGenerator
				Create a main method and initialize 5 Customer objects with random values.
				Output the customer information (Name, both addresses, the order number)

			You can format this output however you would like, however points will be deducted if
			the output is not legible or is easily misunderstood due the the layout.
